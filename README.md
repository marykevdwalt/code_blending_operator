# code_blending_operator
Matlab code for blending interpolation scheme

This contains the Matlab code that describes the spline interpolation scheme in [my paper](http://www.m-hikari.com/ams/ams-2016/ams-5-8-2016/p/vanderwaltAMS5-8-2016.pdf).

To get started, run the file main_blending.m.

You can change the input data set in the file data.m.
